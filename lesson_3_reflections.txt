GITHUB
git command lines learnt :
-git remote [-v] (display the remotes)
-git remote add remote_name URI..
-git push remote_name branch_name (local -> github)
-git pull remote_name branch_name (github -> local)
-git fetch remote_name (when coflict between github and local, to update your local origin/master)

Good to know :
- git pull origin master = git fetch origin + git merge master origin/master
- when resolving conflicts : 
-> git merge origin/master master
-> subl conflict_file
-> git add
-> git commit


When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working on a project with other people of if you are using different laptops to work on your projects.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If your are working on sth and sb else pushed if you pull automatically there will be some conflict.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are like clone but on GitHub. Clone is for making a copy of a repository. A branch is a different version of your project you work on.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
